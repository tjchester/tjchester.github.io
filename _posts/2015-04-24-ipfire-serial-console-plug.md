Recently I was reinstalling the IPFire firewall software on the headless server that I had previously written about. In preparing for the installation I was having trouble getting the serial console connection setup properly. After several frustrating attempts I resolved to search the internet. My first search on *Bing* for the phrase *ipfire serial console* turned up a series of hits. The first two were from the IPFire website. Looking down the list to the fifth entry, I was surprised to see my previous article.

I primarily write articles to help myself and hope that they will in turn help others. This is confirmation that at least the first premise is correct.
