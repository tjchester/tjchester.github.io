Thomas is an IT professional with 19 years of experience across development, helpdesk, and administration roles. He was doing DevOps before it had a formal name. The majority of his skills are self-taught and while he may not be an expert on any one technology; he has a firm understanding of many technologies that allow him to bring a holistic viewpoint to most problems. For each problem he considers commercial versus open-source and buy versus build and will select the solution that best meets the constraints of price and functionality of the original problem. Most of his career has been spent in either small IT departments or niche areas within larger departments. In many cases he has had limited or no mentorship which has taught him to be efficient and self-reliant. He gets things done and works best in an environment without micro-management and that affords the necessary control for him to be self-sufficient and affect a meaningful impact on your company.
